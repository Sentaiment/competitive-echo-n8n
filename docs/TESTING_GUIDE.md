# Testing Guide for 529 Error Fix

## **Problem Identified**

When the HTTP request fails with a 529 error, n8n stops execution and nothing gets passed to the next node.

## **Solution Applied**

1. **Disabled built-in retries** in HTTP request node
2. **Enabled `neverError: true`** to pass error data through
3. **Added comprehensive error detection** in the retry handler
4. **Added debug logging** to see what data comes through

## **Updated HTTP Request Configuration**

```json
{
  "retry": {
    "enabled": false,
    "maxRetries": 0,
    "retryDelay": 0
  },
  "response": {
    "response": {
      "neverError": true,
      "responseFormat": "json",
      "fullResponse": true
    }
  }
}
```

## **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Add the Fix Node**

1. Create a new Code node after your HTTP request
2. Copy the code from `000_immediate529Fix.js`
3. Connect: HTTP Request ‚Üí 529 Fix ‚Üí Continue workflow

### **Step 2: Test with a Request**

1. Run your workflow
2. If a 529 error occurs, check the logs for:
   ```
   üîç DEBUG: Full item data: {...}
   üö® 529 ERROR DETECTED!
   ‚úÖ SCHEDULING RETRY 1/5
   ```

### **Step 3: Verify Data Flow**

The debug log will show you exactly what data structure is coming through, so we can adjust the error detection if needed.

## **Expected Behavior Now**

### **Before Fix:**

- HTTP request fails with 529
- Workflow stops completely
- No data passed to next node

### **After Fix:**

- HTTP request fails with 529
- Error data passes through to 529 Fix node
- 529 Fix node detects the error
- Retry is scheduled with delay
- Request is retried automatically

## **Debug Information**

The fix now includes debug logging that will show:

- Full item data structure
- Whether 529 error is detected
- Retry scheduling details
- Delay calculations

## **If Still No Data Comes Through**

1. **Check the debug logs** - they'll show what data structure is received
2. **Verify HTTP request settings** - make sure `neverError: true` is set
3. **Check node connections** - ensure the 529 Fix node is connected after HTTP request
4. **Test with a single request** to isolate the issue

## **Success Indicators**

‚úÖ You see debug logs showing item data
‚úÖ You see `üö® 529 ERROR DETECTED!` message
‚úÖ You see `‚úÖ SCHEDULING RETRY` message
‚úÖ The request eventually succeeds after retry

The key change is that the HTTP request will now pass through error data instead of stopping the workflow completely.
